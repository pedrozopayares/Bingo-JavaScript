This is an app that randomly select a word from a list of words. The file has one word for line in CSV or TXT format.

In the *[./data](https://github.com/pedrozopayares/Bingo-JavaScript/tree/main/data)* folder of the app directory is a example file. You can test the app with this list.

Internally, the Bingo JavaScript app loads CSV file from local and set the words in an JavaScript Array using a FileReader Object. Later, you can click the bingo button to randomly select a single word. The participants need to have a card with several words to be filled.

The first person or team to fill the card with all the words can sing their victory by shouting ...

## *Bingo!*
